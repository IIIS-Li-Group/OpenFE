OpenFE is a new framework for automated feature generation for tabular data. 
OpenFE is easy-to-use, effective, and efficient with following advantages:
- OpenFE can discover effective candidate features for improving the learning performance of both GBDT and neural networks.
- OpenFE is efficient and supports parallel computing.
- OpenFE covers 23 useful and effective operators for generating candidate features.
- OpenFE supports binary-classification, multi-classification, and regression tasks.

For further details, please refer to [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12507). 

Extensive comparison experiments on public datasets show that OpenFE outperforms existing feature generation methods on both effectiveness and efficiency.
Moreover, we validate OpenFE on the [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ieee-fraud-detection)
Kaggle competition, and show that a simple XGBoost model with features generated by OpenFE 
beats 99.3% of 6351 data science teams. The features generated by OpenFE results in larger performance
improvement than the features provided by the first-place team in the competition.

Get Started and Documentation
-----------------------------

**Installation**

It is recommended to use **pip** for installation.

```
pip install openfe
```

Please do not use **conda install openfe** for installation.
It will install another python package different from ours.

**A Quick Example**

It only takes four lines of codes to generate features by OpenFE. First, we generate features by OpenFE.
Next, we augment the train and test data by the generated features.

```
from openfe import openfe, transform

ofe = openfe()
features = ofe.fit(data=train_x, label=train_y, n_jobs=n_jobs)  # generate new features
train_x, test_x = transform(train_x, test_x, features, n_jobs=n_jobs) # transform the train and test data according to generated features.
```

We provide an example using the standard california_housing dataset in 
[this link](<https://github.com/IIIS-Li-Group/OpenFE/blob/master/examples/california_housing.py>). 
A more complicated example demonstrating OpenFE can outperform machine learning experts in the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection 
Kaggle competition is provided in [this link](<https://github.com/IIIS-Li-Group/OpenFE/blob/master/examples/IEEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection/>).
Users can also refer to our [documentation] for more advanced usage of OpenFE and FAQ about feature generation.
